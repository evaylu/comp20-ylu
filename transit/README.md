This is a program of MBTA Map and Schedule Rodeo for COMP 20 assignment 3.

The index.html file contains a map, and it detects user's current location, marks it on the map, and displays a info window that gives the closest subway station and a poly line that connects user and the station. Also, a certain line of MBTA is maped with corresponding colored line, and each station is marked with T icon; clicking on the icon, a info window connected to it will display information about the station including the name of the station, the arrival schedule, the direction, etc.
