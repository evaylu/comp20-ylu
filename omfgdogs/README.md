This is my imitation version of the famouse OMFGDOGS(http://www.omfgdogs.com/).

I implemented the index.html and omfgdogs.css files as the lab insructions required. The omfgdogs.gif covers the entireweb page and omfgdogs.mp3 auto loops. Also, when the browser width is less than 992 pixels wide, the message "No OMFGDOGS for you" displays. there is a link to the original OMFGDOGS website on the bottom-right of the page.


I wrote the media queries code after studying the article at MDN(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=CSS%2FMedia_queries).

I spent about 3 hours on this assignment(including related reading).
