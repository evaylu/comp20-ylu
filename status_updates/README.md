This is a file for COMP20 - lab 5.

As required, I copied and modified the page(http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/assignments/profile.html), so that the messages entered in the input box will be displayed in the "Update" section, in the format: MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM - the message. The latest update will show at the front.

There are some materials I referred to when doing this lab. Including the course website(http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming), MDN, w3schools.com, and the book - JavaScript for the World Wide Web by Tom Negrino and Dori Smith.
