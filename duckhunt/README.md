This program is a modified, playable JavaScript version of Duck Hunt game, and will be playabe on the web browser.

So far I finished Part I of the program Duck Hunt.

In this assignment, I implemented game.js, so that it will draw a few basic graphics to the canvas in a method named draw(). On the canvas, there will be:
	the sky;
	the dirt road and bushes;
	a tree;
	the dog sniffing the road;
	five flying birds in the sky.
The drawImage() function from the Canvas API was used to cut images from the spirit sheet and draw on the canvas.

There are some resource I referred to while doing this assignment: the course webpages,MDN(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D), stackoverflow(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8346418/image-drawn-to-html5-canvas-does-not-display-correctly-on-first-load).

I spent about 4 hours on reading related materials and completing this assignment.
